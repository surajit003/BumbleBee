Bumblebee is a web framework built in Python
My intent is to be able to build a web application using Bumblebee
The initial inspiration of the framework was derived from
https://rahmonov.me/posts/write-python-framework-part-one/

Currently it has support for the following features
1. Runs on top of Gunicorn on Ubuntu
2. Has handler support for request and response with Keyword arguments
